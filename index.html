  <h2>About this chart</h2>
  <p>
    I’ve recently compiled and analysed hundreds of technical and macroeconomic indicators from highly regarded sources like the Federal Reserve (FRED) and the blockchain itself.  
    After extensive backtesting, I distilled this data into a focused set of signals that reliably highlight the best long-term cyclical buying and selling windows for Bitcoin—shown by the coloured bands.

    <b>Important:</b> In most cases, simply buying and holding an asset you believe in (like BTC or a fund) has outperformed the majority of short-term trading strategies. This chart is best used for education, context, and timing major cycles—not for trading. It is my first large coding project.

        <b>My risk assessment:</b>
        <p>
          Despite BTC having mathematically guaranteed scarcity, being deflationary in nature and pioneering decentralised design, I remain cautious about its long-term prospects. Key risks include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Quantum Computing Threats:</b> Future advances in quantum computing could break Bitcoin’s cryptography, but achieving global consensus on upgrades is uncertain.</li>
          <li><b>Lack of Intrinsic Value:</b> Bitcoin’s value depends entirely on collective belief, unlike assets tied to cash flow or industrial use.</li>
          <li><b>Environmental and Technical Challenges:</b> Proof-of-work requires high energy consumption and may become inefficient compared to newer consensus methods.</li>
          <li><b>Regulatory Uncertainty:</b> Governments might impose restrictive regulations or bans, threatening adoption and price stability.</li>
          <li><b>Strategic Accumulation &amp; Market Manipulation:</b> Large actors, including governments, could amass Bitcoin to exert market influence or destabilise confidence, though such control is costly and difficult.</li>
          <li><b>Centralisation Risks:</b> Mining pools and large holders (whales) may threaten Bitcoin’s decentralised ethos.</li>
          <li><b>Technological Obsolescence:</b> Superior blockchain technologies might erode Bitcoin’s dominance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>On the positive side:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Absolute Digital Scarcity:</b> Bitcoin’s supply is fixed and transparent, unlike physical commodities that could be expanded through mining innovations.</li>
          <li><b>Network Effects:</b> Bitcoin’s first-mover advantage, extensive developer ecosystem, and institutional adoption bolster its resilience.</li>
          <li><b>Store-of-Value Narrative:</b> Increasingly seen as a hedge against fiat inflation and geopolitical risks.</li>
          <li><b>Libertarian Ideals:</b> Rooted in decentralisation and censorship resistance, it continues to attract ideological and financial support.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A frequently debated perspective is whether Bitcoin functions as a decentralised Ponzi scheme — where early adopters profit as new investors drive demand. While lacking a central orchestrator and deceptive guarantees, Bitcoin’s reliance on continual adoption to sustain prices invites this comparison. However, its transparent market dynamics and real-world utility distinguish it from outright fraud.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, like many transformative innovations, Bitcoin could either revolutionise finance or remain a speculative bubble akin to historic manias.
